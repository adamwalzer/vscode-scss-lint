## Features

This extention runs scss-lint in bash and displays the errors found by highlighting the errors in your scss files upon saving of that file.

## Requirements

This extention is dependant on the ruby gem scss-lint. It has only been tested with version .0.49.0 of scss_lint so we therefore suggest you run the following in your terminal:
`gem install scss_lint -v 0.49.0`

## Extension Settings

This extension does not currently take any settings. Simply install it, and it works.

## Known Issues

At this time there are no known issues with this extension as it has been tested very limitedly.

## Release Notes

### See the CHANGELOG for notes on each release.
