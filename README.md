# scss-lint README

This is a small scss-lint extension for vscode.

![Alt text](images/demo.gif?raw=true "Demo Gif")

## Features

This extention runs scss-lint in bash and displays the errors found by highlighting the errors in your scss files upon saving of that file.

## Requirements

This extention is dependant on the ruby gem scss-lint. It has only been tested with version .0.49.0 of scss_lint so we therefore suggest you run the following in your terminal:
`gem install scss_lint -v 0.49.0`

## Extension Settings

This extension itself does not currently take any settings, but it runs scss-lint which uses your .scss-lint.yml file. Simply install the extension, and it works.

## Known Issues

At this time there are no known issues, but please feel free to report any you come across.

## Release Notes

### See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for notes on each release.
